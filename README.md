## How does it work?
If you click on a video on a UbiCast server, your browser loads the URL to the correspondig [HLS playlist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) by querying the following API endpoint:
`https://ubicast-server.tld/api/v2/medias/modes/?oid=<oid>&html5=<format-list>`.

This addon listens to requests to this API endpoint by matching URLs against this regex: `*://*/api/v2/medias/modes/*`. The parameter `html5` specifies a list of formats, sepereated by underscores, in which you want to receive the video e.g.: `html5=webm_ogg_ogv_oga_mp4_m4a_mp3_m3u8`. Normally this list contains the format `m3u8` (HLS playlist) to stream the video with the webplayer. If you want a direct link to the video or audio file, you can just remove the media type `m3u8` from the query. That's what this addon does.

Every video has a unique ID which is called `oid`. With this `oid` you are also able to query meta information from the api endpoint `https://ubicast-server.tld/api/v2/medias/get/?oid=<oid>`.
These meta information are queried to display the correct video title and, if available, the speakers name and licensing information.

## About this project
This addon is my first open source project and also the first WebExtension I've developed. So please be patient with me ðŸ˜„ I've mainly developed for Firefox but principally it should run in any browser with support for WebExtensions.

My goals were to keep the addon as lightweight and simple as possible. That's why I avoided using large javascript libraries like React or CSS frameworks like Bootstrap. I'm also using Emoji instead of icons (that could actually be a dumb idea). Also I thought it would be nice to support an [automatic darkmode with CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).
